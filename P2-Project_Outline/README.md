## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app is geared towards reducing food waste by helping Users keep track of their items expiration dates and by finding recipes that make use of the ingredients that they are trying to make use of. Users will be able to log on and track items they bought as the grocery store by adding them to their pantry with their expiration date. Users will be alerted when items are about to expire and they will be able to track how much food they are wasting. Users will also be able to search for recipes based on the items they have in their pantry and add their own recipes for other users to make use of.

### What I'll Have to Learn
Include what you will need to learn here

In designing this project I will learn how to implement a search bar. I hope also to make use of an API related to food ingredients to make this easier. Additionally I plan to learn some JavaScript to make the website more interactive. I may explore some other options for making user information secure.
