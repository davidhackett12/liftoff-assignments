## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app will be a Fantasy Cross Country application similar to other fantasy applications. Currently I am in a league which only uses email to communicate with excel documents to display team rosters and results. To make the running of a league easier users will be able to create a league and invite other users to join and create teams. Users will be able to manage their teams including adding and dropping runners from their team, proposing trades with other teams, and set their lineups week to week. Additionally league standings and weekly results will be calculated via the application and can be viewed by users. Ideally the application will eventually be able to automatically update results.

### Features

*	User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. 
*	Create/Join a League: Users will be able to create or join a league; eventually invitations will be via email.
*	Manage Team: Users will be able to create a team, edit basics, add runners, set their lineups, and propose trades with other teams.
*	View Standings/Results: Users will be able to view their League Standings and weekly results on the website.
*	Messages: Users will be able to communicate with other users on the website and post to a general forum

Backlogged Features
* Email: invites will be done through email. 
* Upload a list of runners: Commissioners will be able to upload an excel or csv of runners that each get converted into a runner object that users can then select to be on their team.
* Upload a race: Commissioners will be able to include a link to race results that the application will automatically comb through for results for runners
